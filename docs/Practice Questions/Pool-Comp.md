# Pool Competition

Adam regularly challenges one of his teachers to a pool competition.  

The winner of their matches is the person who wins the most individual games of pool.

Adam wishes to write a computer program to calculate the total number of times each player wins a game and display a message congratulating the winner of the overall match.  

> ## Task 1

Adam wants the program to:

* Repeatedly ask the user to input the winner of each game

* Stop asking for input when the character “X” is entered

* Add up the number of wins for each player as the winner of each game is inputted

* Display a message congratulating the player who won the most games or display a message saying that the match was tied. 

**Write a program that meets Adam’s requirements.  (6)**

<br>

> ## Task 2

Assuming that five games have been played, state two sets of test data that could be used to demonstrate that two of the messages display correctly when either Adam or his teacher have won the match. (2)

> ## Task 3

State the type of loop you used in your program.  (1)

> ## Task 4

In the final program Adam doesn’t use input validation when the user is asked to input the winner’s name or ‘X’.  

Explain why this could lead to the program not calculating the result correctly.  (2)
