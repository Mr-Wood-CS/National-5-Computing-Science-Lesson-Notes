    ==Instructions==

    Create a program that will ask a user to enter a number. This number will be added to a total and as long as the total is below __50__ it will ask the user to input another number.

    | Inputs       | Process              | Output
    | -----------  | ---------------------|-----------------------
    | Integer      | Add integer to total | Total
    |              | If total below 50    | Enter another number

    ** Pseudocode

    1. Set the total to 0 to start with
   
    2. While the total is 50 or less, ask the user to enter a number.
   
    3. Add that number to the total and print the message "The Total is".....[total].
   
    5. Stop the loop when the total is over 50.
