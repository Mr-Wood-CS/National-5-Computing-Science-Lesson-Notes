# Conditional Loops (while)

## Explanation

A conditional loop (__in Python, a while loop__) repeats only while a condition is true. 

A conditional loop is like a combination of a fixed loop and an if statement and you can use all of the same conditions in a while loop that you would in an if statement.

* In this example, the user is asked to enter a number. 

* If the number is more than 100, part of the program repeats, asking them to enter the number again. 

* It only repeats while their input is more than 100. Once that condition is met, the loop stops repeating and the program continues:

!!! example

	```python linenums="1"
		# Initialise the variable
		mynumber = 0
		
		# Ask the user to enter a number
		mynumber = int(input("Please enter a number"))
		
		# Example of a while loop
		while mynumber > 100:
			print("That number is too big!")
			mynumber = int(input("Please enter a number"))
	```

!!! warning "Warning - Donâ€™t get stuck in an __infinite loop__!"

	Make sure that your condition will always end.
	
	For example, this loop would never end as 100 is always more than 5, so the loop will continue running indefinitely.

	```python linenums="1"
		while 100 > 5:
			print("One hundred is still more than five")
	```

## Extension Tasks

!!! example "01 - Fifty or Less"

    ==Analysis==
	
	Create a program that will ask a user to enter a number. This number will be added to a total and as long as the total is below __50__ it will ask the user to input another number.
		
	| Inputs       | Process              | Output
	| -----------  | ---------------------|-----------------------
	| Integer      | Add integer to total | Total
	|              | If total below 50    | Enter another number
		
    ==Pseudocode==

    __Main Steps__
		
	1. Set total TO 0 
	
	2. Start conditional loop

	2.1 While number != 50
 
	2.2 Ask user to enter a number
 
	2.3 Add number to total
 
	2.4 Display total
